## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to security@hawkeyepatro.com.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
